TRPM8 Files and finished work
These are all the relevant materials for my genomics project. I am working on a sample of a south African Vervet population collected by my PI Prof.Schmitt.
With this material i have been runing an analysis on the gene TRPM8, and gene implicated in cold sendation in humans and in mice studies. 
We are looking to see if there are any signs of selection in this population/subpopulations for this TRPM8 gene, as some reseach has found in human populations.
